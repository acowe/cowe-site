                    <p className={"fs-5 fw-normal"}>
                        Since I was young, I've enjoyed learning about various STEM topics through online media like Wikipedia and YouTube.
                        I was particularly drawn to math and, then, computer science when I became interested in programming.
                        In watching videos like those of 3Blue1Brown or Vsauce, I saw the creativity and imagination inherent in math and computer science.
                        However, many other online resources on CS topics have an overwhelming amount of text, code, and static diagrams
                        that can be hard to follow. This made me wonder: "Why can't these resources be a bit more animated? Motivated by this,
                        Algomations was created and released its first video in June 2023. While only a few videos have been released since then,
                        I hope to make more videos that aid in creative learning, like the ones I have watched thus far.
