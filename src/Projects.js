                    <p> For my final project in Information Visualization (ECS272), a fellow classmate and I were tasked with building a visualization system
                        for visualizing a large volumetric turbulent combustion dataset to effectively show important spatial statistical features and behavior of a premixed flame.
                        Utilizing Tyson Neuroth's <a href={"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06970"}>voronoi decomposition method</a>  as a base, we devised, then developed a web-based system that would allow users to select 2D cross sections of the data volume,
                        then hierarchically navigate the slice data by levels of visual abstraction (layer, component, cell).
                        At each level, aggregate statistics for selected cross-section elements would be displayed in the side view with the scatter plot and bar chart, allowing for focused data analysis and directed navigation.
                        In building such visualization system, we aimed to promote dataset exploration that is intuitive, accessible, and scalable for combustion scientists and analysts.

                    <h3>Timesheets for EKN Engineering</h3>
                    <p> For my clinic project (Harvey Mudd College's senior capstone project), I colloborated with four other students and liasons from EKN Engineering
                        to re-architect “Timesheets”, EKN's own project management application. Because Timesheets was built from scratch, it suffered from a host of usability issues
                        stemming from poorly designed user interface (UI) layouts and components, significantly dampening user satisfaction and productivity among employees.
                        Hence, our goal was to improve usability by revising Timesheets' design and functionalities, then integrating those changes into the existing application.
                        Per the SCRUM development process, we regularly consulted with EKN's project managers, UI/UX designers, and technical experts to design, program and test
                        the re-architected version of Timesheets, taking advantage of tools like Figma, Jira, and Bitbucket. Per EKN's specifications, we implemented
                        custom UI components that functioned with employee's Timesheets data from EKN's employee database using Vue.js, Javascript APIs, PHP, and Laravel. Compared to the old Timesheets, our new version streamlined user interaction and greatly improved user satisfaction
                        as was supported by the user tests we conducted with EKN employees. We documented our collective progress through a statement of work report, presented the re-architected version of Timesheets to professors, students, and liasons at HMC Projects Day 2023,
                        then turned in our final deliverables and documentation to EKN Engineering.

                    <h3>Gradescope Calendar</h3>
                    <p> For Harvey Mudd College's Summer StartUp Program 2022, I collaborated with two other students to conceptualize, design, and build Gradescope Calendar.
                        For context, Gradescope is an assignment submission portal that many universities, including Harvey Mudd, utilize.
                        It displays assignment due dates but only in list format, making calendar scheduling tedious and inconvenient.  We based our proposed startup product around this problem and came up with Gradescope Calendar as a solution.
                        We first conducted research to scope out potential user-bases. Then, we proposed our product to students
                        and formulated product specifications around the feedback we gathered. From there, we used Canva and UML diagrams to architect Gradescope Calendar, then developed it using React and Axios.
                        The final result is a web-application that can scrape due dates from Harvey Mudd students' Gradescope accounts then display the information as an interactive calendar and list.
                        It offers numerous functionalities that automates and aids in scheduling, with the most exciting being the Google Calendar export. These features garnered positive feedback from students and professors alike.

                    <p>For my final project in Computer Vision (CS153), a classmate and I explored
                        a method for reconstructing a 3D structure from 2D images using the <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-point_algorithm#:~:text=The%20eight%2Dpoint%20algorithm%20is,case%20of%20the%20essential%20matrix."}>8-point algorithm</a>.

                    <p>For my final project in Discrete Differential Geometry (CSMT181A), I explored the mathematical connections between image feature detection in computer vision
                        and differential exterior calculus. The results of this exploration is presented as an <a href={"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IZMvUdYV0cXyQC-Pr3s2nuC0eBalVNsi?usp=sharing"}>interactive jupyter notebook</a> in

                        I designed them as silly hydra-like creatures such with the hope of engaging learners of all ages in lambda calculus, especially in carrying out
